FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Configuring project ':SkipUnit' without an existing directory is not allowed. The configured projectDirectory '/Users/marcocorro/Documents/xCode/Kickbasehelper/KickbaseCore/.build/plugins/outputs/kickbasecore/KickbaseCore/destination/skipstone/SkipUnit' does not exist, can't be written to or is not a directory.

* Try:
> Make sure the project directory exists and is writable.
> For more information, see https://docs.gradle.org/9.3.0/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#include_existing_projects_only
> Run with --scan to get full insights from a Build Scan (powered by Develocity).
